Python Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python:
  int
  float
  complex
Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:
Example:
  x = 1    # int
  y = 2.8  # float
  z = 1j   # complex

To verify the type of any object in Python, use the type() function:
Example
  print(type(x))
  print(type(y))
  print(type(z))


Int
Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.

Example
  Integers:
    x = 1
    y = 35656222554887711
    z = -3255522
    
    print(type(x))
    print(type(y))
    print(type(z))


Float
Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.

Example
  Floats:
    x = 1.10
    y = 1.0
    z = -35.59
    
    print(type(x))
    print(type(y))
    print(type(z))
Float can also be scientific numbers with an "e" to indicate the power of 10.
Example
  Floats:
    x = 35e3
    y = 12E4
    z = -87.7e100
    
    print(type(x))
    print(type(y))
    print(type(z))

Complex
Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part:
Example
  Complex:
  x = 3+5j
  y = 5j
  z = -5j
  
  print(type(x))
  print(type(y))
  print(type(z))

Random Number
Python does not have a random() function to make a random number, but Python has a built-in module called random that can be used to make random numbers:
  Example:
    Import the random module, and display a random number between 1 and 9:
      import random
      
      print(random.randrange(1, 10))



Exercise:
  Insert the correct syntax to convert x into a floating point number.
  x = 5
  x = float(x)


Exercise:
  Insert the correct syntax to convert x into a integer.
  x = 5.5
  x = int(x)


Exercise:
  Insert the correct syntax to convert x into a complex number.
  x = 5
  x = complex(x)
